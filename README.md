THIS CODE IS MY LEARNING PLAYGROUND

I am new to rust.

Be careful, if you use it for learning purposes: it may contain many newcomer errors.

Be extremely careful, if you want to run this code: it MAY ACCIDENTALLY ERASE YOUR FILES!

This code is supposed to synchronize two collections of files, especially if they are stored on different media.
It tries to move files rather than copy.
